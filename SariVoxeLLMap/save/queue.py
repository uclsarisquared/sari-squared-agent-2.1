"""
Universal queue for saving plots and other files,
so that the main process will focus on actual processing and not be blocked by file I/O.

Due to this problem:
- Even though the processing and saving successfully occur in separate threads in the voxelization submodule,
this only occurs within each frame processing.
- Therefore, for the next frame to be processed, the previous frame's overall processing (including saving) must be completed.
- To combat this, there should be a single universal queue for saving files, so that the main process can focus on processing frames and not be blocked by file I/O.
